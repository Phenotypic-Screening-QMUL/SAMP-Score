# SAMP-Score

Development of a machine learning tool for senescence classification based on previous SAMP methodology. SAMP-Score has been built and utilised through analysis of high throughput screening data and multiparameter phenotypic analysis:

Genome-wide siRNA (x63 384-well plates – 24,122 treatments).
Compound diversity library (x61 384-well plates – 20,000 treatments).
Hit validation dose response (x30 384-well plates – 8,940 treatments).

SAMP-Score is a stacked ensemble model employing consensus predictions from: logistic regression, lasso regularisation, elastic nets, support vector machines, random forrest, multiple discriminant analysis and nerual networks. 

SAMP-Score has been used to identify novel compounds that initiate a senescence response in cancer cells, demonstrating its utility as a drug discovery tool
